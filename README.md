# Hybrid LLM API ðŸš€

This project is about **gaining hands-on experience building APIs from scratch** using **FastAPI**.  
It integrates both **OpenAI models** and **Ollama (Llama2)** to explore how different LLMs can be connected under a single API.

---

## âœ¨ What I Learned
- Building a REST API from scratch using **FastAPI**
- Integrating **OpenAI API** (with API keys)
- Running **Ollama (Llama2)** locally and exposing it via endpoints
- Managing environment variables for security
- Understanding deployment considerations (OpenAI works on cloud, Ollama requires local/server setup)
